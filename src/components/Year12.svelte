    <h2>College Goal</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to be able to receive a scholarship to study at the
      <span>University of Toronto</span>, majoring
      <span>Computer Science</span>. I believe that it would give me a good
      opportunity in life, allowing me to learn and meet a diverse group of
      people. Though, I do have alternate plans prepared if I fail to get
      accepted.

    <h2>Extra Curricular</h2>
    <p>
      I decided that this year, I'd like to explore my other interests,
      <span>photography</span> being one of them. I've joined the school photography
      club in hopes that I can learn to take better photographs and also videos.
      I've always had some interest in photography, but have not explored it until
      now.

      organization assisting the Student Council (OSIS) with spreading
